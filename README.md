# Magnolia

**Magnolia** is a new UI toolkit written entirely from scratch in [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) for Linux desktops.

The only system dependencies are X11 and OpenGL.

> Note: this project is a WIP and still in a very experimental state. Stay tuned for more updates.

As far as problem space you can consider this project as an alternative to a mix of GTK/KDE/QT and GNOME/Plasma depending on which part of the code you're using.
